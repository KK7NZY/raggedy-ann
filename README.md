# Raggady Ann

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app that lets you ask questions about a PDF using a local Ollama LLM and FAISS vector search.

## üì¶ Features

- Converts PDFs to plain text
- Builds a vector store using sentence embeddings
- Retrieves relevant chunks via FAISS
- Interactive CLI session for asking questions about the book

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Python 3.13+
* uv 0.7.3+
* Ollama
* direnv

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Install dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv sync --no-dev
```

2. Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

```bash
curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash # or brew install direnv
```

3. Add `direnv` shell hook

```bash
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  # or zsh/fish/etc.
```


4. Create a `.envrc` file with your Ollama host:

```env
export OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"
```

5. Allow the `.envrc` file.

```bash
direnv allow .
```

5. Add your PDF file to the `assets/pdf/` directory and run.


## üöÄ Usage

1. Add your PDF to `assets/pdf/`.
2. Run the app:

```bash
uv run main.py --pdf-filename therustbook.pdf
````

Use `--override` to rebuild the vector store if it already exists:

```bash
uv run main.py --pdf-filename therustbook.pdf --override
```

The extracted text will be saved to `assets/txt/directory/` using the same name as the PDF (with a `.txt` extension).

The FAISS vector store will be saved to `vector_stores/<pdf_name>/`, using the PDF filename (without extension) as the folder name.


## üìö Example Questions

* What chapters cover concurrency in Rust?
* How does borrowing work?
* Where in the book is the concept of iterators explained?
* Where are lifetimes explained?

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

Set up the development environment with `pre-commit` and `uv`.

```bash
uv sync # --only-dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

Pre-Commit hooks are set up for linting and formatting. They run automatically before commits, but can also be triggered manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
